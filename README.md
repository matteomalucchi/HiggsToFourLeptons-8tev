# Analysis of Higgs boson decays to four leptons

This repository contains an analysis of the decay of a Higgs boson into two Z bosons which in turn decay in four leptons using reduced NanoAOD files created from CMS Open Data. The analysis follows loosely [the official CMS analysis published in 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312008581).

# How to run this

The complete analysis can be performed by simply running `python main.py`. This automatically runs all the code necessary to perform the complete analysis. The single steps can be executed separately as explained in more detail below.
