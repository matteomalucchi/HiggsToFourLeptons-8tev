Welcome to HiggsToFourLeptons-8tev's documentation!
===================================================


**HiggsToFourLeptons-8tev** is a 1 project that makes use of the Python language 
and is interfaced with ROOT, and provides analysis tools for the Higgs decay in
two Z bosons which subsequently decay in four leptons. The datasets used are
reduced NanoAOD files created from CMS Open Data 
(found \href{http://opendata.cern.ch/record/12360}{here}).
The analysis follows loosely 
\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312008581}{the official CMS analysis published in 2012}.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to
:ref:`install <installation>` the project.

The definitions of the functions can be found in the section.
